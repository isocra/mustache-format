# mustache-format
Add Formatters to Mustache for better rendering

This is based on https://github.com/jvitela/mustache-wax. All the clever code comes from there.

This repo is aimed at creating an npm package so that people can use it more easily using `npm install mustache-format` 

(NB this isn't working yet as it's very early days and hasn't been published yet.)
